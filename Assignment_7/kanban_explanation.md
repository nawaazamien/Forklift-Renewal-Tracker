# üõ†Ô∏è Kanban Board Explanation

## What is a Kanban Board?

A Kanban board is a tool that helps teams organize and track their work. It shows tasks as cards and moves them through different stages, like `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`. This makes it easy to see what needs to be done, what is being worked on, and what is finished.

## How Does Our Kanban Board Work?

1. **Visualizing Workflow**  
   - The columns on the board represent the progress of tasks.  
   - For example:
     - `To Do`: Tasks that haven‚Äôt started yet.  
     - `In Progress`: Tasks that are being worked on.  
     - `Testing`: Tasks that are being checked for quality.  
     - `Blocked`: Tasks that are stuck and need help to move forward.  
     - `Done`: Tasks that are completed.  
   - As tasks move through these columns, we can see how the work is progressing.

2. **Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)**  
   - We limit the number of tasks in the `In Progress` column to avoid doing too many things at once.  
   - This helps the team focus on finishing tasks before starting new ones.  
   - For example, we only allow 3 tasks in `In Progress` at a time. If the column is full, we finish a task before adding a new one.

3. **Supporting Agile Principles**  
   - The board helps us deliver work continuously by showing what needs to be done next.  
   - It is flexible, so if priorities change, we can easily move tasks around.  
   - By focusing on one task at a time and testing it before marking it as `Done`, we ensure high-quality work.
