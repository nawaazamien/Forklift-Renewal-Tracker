## Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template

Choosing the right GitHub template was tricky because each one had its pros and cons. The **Basic Kanban** template was simple but didnâ€™t have automation, while the **Automated Kanban** template had helpful features like moving tasks automatically but needed extra setup. Deciding which one fit the project best took some time.

Customizing the board was also a bit challenging. Adding columns like `Testing` and `Blocked` required thinking about how tasks would move through the workflow. Setting limits for how many tasks could be in progress at once (WIP limits) was hard because we had to balance the teamâ€™s workload and keep things moving smoothly.

## Comparing GitHubâ€™s Templates to Other Tools

GitHubâ€™s templates are great because they work well with code projects. You can link tasks to issues and pull requests, which makes tracking progress easy. However, compared to other tools like **Trello** and **Jira**, GitHub is simpler.

- **Trello**: Trello is easy to use and lets you customize the board with colors and labels. But it doesnâ€™t connect to code as well as GitHub does, so itâ€™s not as good for software projects.

- **Jira**: Jira has lots of advanced features like sprint planning and reports, which are great for big teams. But itâ€™s harder to use and takes more time to set up, so itâ€™s not ideal for smaller projects.

GitHubâ€™s templates are simple and work well for small teams and software projects like the **Forklift License Renewal Tracker**. While tools like Trello and Jira have more features, GitHubâ€™s integration with code makes it the best choice for this project.
